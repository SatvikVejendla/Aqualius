# Aqualius
Hello. It looks like you are intersted in Aqualius.
A useful discord bot I programmed in 3 days. Prior to these 3 days, I had no knowledge whatsoever of how to code a discord bot. I didn't even know that there is a package called "discord.js". I learned all the necessary code in 3 days.

This bot is basically a combination of MEE6, Pollbot, with some additional features.

The way this bot works is by deploying to a third-party application, Heroku, which automatically runs the script "index.js" almost forever. In order to copy this code, clone this repository and instead of "process.env.TOKEN" at the bottom of "index.js", type in your own bot token. The type "require('dotenv').config" at the top of your code. Then just type "node index.js" in the terminal and your bot should be up.
If you would like to make this bot with Heroku or have any questions, reach out to me at satvej1@gmail.com.

Link to invite the bot to your server: https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=776553487244066866&scope=bot
None of the data is stored anywhere. All your commands are private to you.
